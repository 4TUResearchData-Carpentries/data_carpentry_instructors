# Notes file for Helpers

This file is to hold notes about issues that you find learners have in the classroom, and how to help them quickly. If you find more than 2 or 3 people have similar issues,
please make a note in here so that future helpers can use your experience to help resolve issues quickly and get learners back on track.

## Intro to R

### Installing RStudio

#### Example problem installing on Windows 10
If the learner has a problem installing on Win 10 they should probably use a Windows installer instead of a Mac one. (Obviously, this is a sample issue to illustrate the planned layout of this document)

### Library issues

## Spreadsheets

## OpenRefine

## Visualisation

## Quarto
